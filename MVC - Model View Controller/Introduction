A Model-View-Controller (MVC) Approach

1. There are three components:
    - Model (The data element of the program)
    - View (The user interface element of the program)
    - Controller (The "Business Logic" of the program)

2. The Model
    - The data of the program.

3. The View
    - Requests from the Model
    - Listens to the Model
    - Gets data from the model

    - Overall, just represents data.

4. The Controller
    - Instructs/commands the Model.
    - Instructs/commands the View.
    - Can listen to the Model.
    - Can listen to the View.

    - Overall, the brains of the operation.
